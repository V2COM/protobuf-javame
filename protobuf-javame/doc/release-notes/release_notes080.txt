protobuf-javame 0.8.0 release notes
--------------------------------

- Added support for read and write delimited. This means messages will write the size of the protobuf message before sending it.
- Added AbstractOutputWriter, this will contain a few common methods and therefore reduce the amount of code needed to be generated.
- New tests for the DelimitedInputStream object.
- New example (FileExample in the protobuf-javame-examples project) that shows the use of writeTo, writeDelimitedTo, readFrom and readDelimitedFrom.
