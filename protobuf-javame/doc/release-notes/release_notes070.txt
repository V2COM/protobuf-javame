protobuf-javame 0.7.0 release notes
--------------------------------

- Updated error message to list out the input when too many input arguments are sent in.
- Supports backward compatibility of proto-files. 
  This means you can update the proto-file, add new fields for example, 
  and the old implementations will still be supported. 
  Although the new fields will of course not be available on the old implementation.
